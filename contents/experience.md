### **6. Community Education Volunteer Services**  
**09/2022– 01/2025**  

Utilized spare time during my first and second years of high school to participate in community education volunteer services, teaching English and other courses to primary school students. During the teaching process, I fully considered the age characteristics and learning needs of primary school students, carefully designing teaching content and methods. For example, in English teaching, I used gamified teaching and storytelling methods to stimulate students' interest in learning. To better understand students' learning progress and mastery, I regularly engaged in one-on-one communication and tutoring, tailoring personalized learning plans based on each student's learning style. After some time of teaching, students showed significant improvement in their English grades. Parents highly praised the teaching work, deeply experiencing the power of education and the value of volunteer work, while also cultivating patience and a sense of responsibility.   Continued serving as a volunteer at Wuhan Library during high school, mainly assisting library staff in organizing books and periodicals, categorizing and shelving books, and maintaining order in the reading area. Through this job, I cultivated a strong sense of responsibility and patience, learned efficient time management and task planning skills, and could reasonably arrange volunteer service time amidst busy academic schedules, ensuring the completion of all tasks. At the same time, the rich collection of books within the library provided me with a good reading environment and learning resources, further broadening my knowledge base and horizons, allowing me to explore multiple areas such as humanities and science, enriching my knowledge reserves, and reinforcing my love and pursuit of knowledge.  

### **7. Environmental Protection Public Welfare Projects**  
**10/2022 – 01/2025**  

I organized and participated in an environmental protection public welfare project during my second year of high school, aimed at raising residents' awareness of environmental protection and promoting sustainable development concepts. At the initial stage of the project, we faced numerous challenges such as financial shortages, insufficient personnel, and low resident participation. Actively and proactively communicated and collaborated with community committees, surrounding enterprises, schools, etc., securing certain financial support and manpower assistance. Delved into the community, conducting a series of colorful environmental protection publicity activities, such as waste sorting lectures, environmental protection creative workshops, and environmental knowledge competitions.In the waste sorting lecture, residents were thoroughly informed about the importance and specific methods of waste sorting through real-life cases and vivid demonstrations, making it easier for them to understand and accept. In the environmental protection creative workshop, residents were guided to make handicrafts from waste materials, which not only enhanced their environmental awareness but also enriched their leisure lives. After several months of effort, the community residents' environmental awareness has significantly improved, with an increase in the recycling rate of waste within the community and a notable improvement in environmental quality. I also deeply realized the positive impact of individual actions on society.
